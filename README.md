Early software development faced challenges due to increasing program complexity. The introduction of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, and ALGOL simplified software development. Structured programming techniques, such as modular design and top-down development, emerged to improve code organization and maintainability. Mastering Process

The rise of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models, including Waterfall, Spiral, and Iterative Development, provided structured approaches to software engineering. Formal methodologies like Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and ISO 9001 standards were introduced to enhance software quality and process efficiency. Object-oriented programming (OOP), with languages like C++ and Java, enabled reusable, scalable, and maintainable software development. Mastering Machines

Cloud computing, virtualization, and DevOps practices revolutionized software deployment and scalability. Agile and DevOps methodologies introduced faster, iterative development cycles and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are now integrated into software engineering, enhancing automation, decision-making, and predictive analytics.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Planning

Define project goals, scope, and feasibility. Identify risks, required resources, and budget. Requirement Analysis

Gather and document user needs and system requirements. Identify functional and non-functional requirements. Design

Create system architecture and design specifications. Develop wireframes, prototypes, and data models. Implementation (Coding & Development)

Developers write the actual code based on the design. Perform unit testing and integrate components. Testing

Check for bugs, errors, and performance issues. Conduct unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing. Deployment

Deploy the software to the production environment. Perform final checks before making it available to users. Maintenance & Updates

Provide support, bug fixes, and updates. Improve functionality based on user feedback

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. Use Waterfall When:

The project has well-defined and stable requirements (e.g., government or regulatory projects). Changes are unlikely to occur once development starts. The project has clear objectives and a fixed timeline. Works best for large-scale infrastructure projects, financial systems, or regulatory environments. ✅ Use Agile When:

The project is flexible and may require frequent changes or iterations. Continuous feedback from stakeholders is needed. The final product is not clearly defined at the start. Best for software development, startups, mobile applications, and innovative projects where adaptability is key.
